Positional Parameters:
    * the first parameter is stored in $1
    * The second parameter is stored in $2
    * $@ contains all the Parameters
    * Just like shell scripts;
        * $0 = the script itself not function name

    Only after the function is called

Local Variables

    * Created using a local keyword
        local LOCAL_VAR = 1
    * Best practise is to keep variables local in a function

     return <RETURN_CODE>
* Implicitly
    exit status of the last command executed in the function
