** while [ CONDITION_IS_TRUE ]
do 
    command 1
    command 2
    command N
    #command changes the condition
done

** if the condition that is checked is always true then 
the while becomes an infinite loop

** Infinite loop
while true
do 
    command N
    sleep 1
done

How to read a file, line by line:
    ** with for loop, the file is read word by word **
    ** hence while loop is used in conjunction with the read command ** 
    ** On the last line of the while loop we add < <file-name-to-read> 
    ** The read command supports the splitting of data

* If we want to get out of the loop before it completes the proceedings
    we can use the break statement

* If we want to break the restart the loop before completion then we use the
    continue statement
