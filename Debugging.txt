** The process of finding errors or fixing unexpected errors
    is called debugging

** -x = Print commands as they execute
    This is called x-trace or print debugging
    * Used after substituitions and expansions
    * To use this debugging behavior in shell scripts
        Start with #!/bin/bash -x
        Or end with set -x- (or just before the command where you run the script)
    
    set +x to stop debugging

** -e = Exit on error
    to pinpoint where the problem is
    Can be combined with other options:
    #!/bin/bash -ex || -xe || -x-e || -e-x

** -v = Prints shell input lines as they are read
    Can be combined with other options

** Manual Debugging 
    Creating own debugging code 
    Using a special variable like DEBUG 
        * DEBUG=true
        * DEBUG=false

    Use a echo as value of DEBUG

    Creating a debug function like:
        debug() {
            echo "Executing $@"
            $@
        }

        debug ls

** Syntax highlighting 
    use text editors

** PS4
    Control what is displayed before a line when using the "+x" option.
    The default value is +
    Bash Variables 
        BASH_SOURCE, LINENO etc
